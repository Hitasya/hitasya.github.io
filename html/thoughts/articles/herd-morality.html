                All too often, we are exhorted or admonished to be 'good,' to pray, to be 'nice.' Repeated often enough, we cease to put the question-mark after such imperatives and the speakers themselves. This isn't to say that 'being good' is inherently wrong, but rather that our unwillingness and consequent inability to question and answer the underlying assumptions & prejudices, motivations, and natures of those people who exhort us to 'be good,' eventually imparts us those same prejudices, motivations, and natures---namely, Pharisaism in the Christian sense of the term, i.e., (religious) hypocrisy; we imbibe a tendency to rigidly adhere to dogma without genuine piety, as censorious and self-righteous spirits in matters of morals and manners.

                Just as the Christian Priest's 'wisdom,' the Pharisaical 'wisdom' too is inherited rather than earned, in the manner and to the effect that earning Wisdom* functioned in Shamanic** practice. If your truths aren't bloody truths to you, then they aren't your truths. That is to say, if your spirituality isn't earned---which it isn't: all we do is regurgitate false science from primary to graduation; the spirituality we do manage to imbibe is through books and words, not through lived solitude as the Shamans did theirs---to the effect that one becomes a bloodless scholar and a hyper-specialized midget. A fairy-tale child will one day point out to us that the emperor wears no clothes, and we all will flush for having been revealed the pretenses our vanity conceals: after all, a person who is embarrassed at their own immorality stands at the bottom step of a path that leads to one eventually being ashamed of one's own morality. And if you won't take that second step, if you don't question those who tell you to be 'good,' and if you don't bloody your truths, you will one day be forced out of your own clothes; perhaps even in your lifetime!

                Pharisaical morality is, by nature, reactive, and is thus a slavish morality, which, as a reactive stance, is founded on revenge and self-preservation.
                Peter Thiel (the billionaire) identifies this slavish morality in our obsession with competition, which is a function of having a system of rules in place to form a game that people can play. Every competition necessitates cooperation, paradoxically, to keep the competition going: after all, you need to agree to a set of rules to play a game, any game. Now, of course, the object of any game is to perpetuate itself by generating winners, who are to be motivated by a desirous object, a desire for which is shared by the many. Thus ensues conflict, because instantly, people are in one-another's way to obtain that limited thing each of them wants to their own greed. Take a reward away from people, and they develop resentment because you're effectively denying them their chance to heroism and thus a life after death (a life in the hereafter? How rational we are!). This is how vengeful drives come to the fore, and they do so because we are driven to self-preservation.

                It is constructed out of reaction to what is 'different' and 'not-itself' rather than from autonomous conviction, and it is driven by hidden self-interest rather than altruism. This explains why Nietzsche characterises it as 'paleness' in contrast to the bold passion of the strong. This explains why Nietzsche characterises it as 'paleness' in contrast to the bold passion of the strong. The moral evaluation of the slaves is, as we saw, 'only a subsequently-invented pale,' contrasting image in relation to its positive basic concept, which is filled with life and passion through and through.' (On the Genealogy of Morals, 37) 

                For example, the religious may speak much of love, but they are incapable of authentic emotion since the virtues they extol are founded on the rationalizeion of their powerlessness and resentment, a weakness that is 'being lied into something meritorious.' When they suffer harm, the religious claim to wait 'patiently' for God's justice and to love those who inflict harm on them, but "love of one's enemies" is nothing but an ideal manufactured through detachment from life experiences and from real feelings. Love of the enemy is nothing more than an unnatural abstraction from the native response of anger and hurt. It is therefore ultimately a form of inverted self hate. In such ways, the religious life is fundamentally 'an attack on the roots of passion' and 'the practice of the church is hostile to life.' (Twilight of the idols, III, 1. 487, in The Portable Nietzsche by Walter Kaufmann) If the religious life thus loses touch with the instinct for life, it is no wonder that 'the pharisees' musunderstand love.  As Max Scheler explains in his classic essay on Nietzsche's analysis of 'ressentimet,' the term for this false love is 'altruism.' Scheler writes,
