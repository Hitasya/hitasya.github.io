                    In the 1838 play The Conspiracy, Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s character Cardinal Richelieu first coined the famous line, “the pen is mightier than the sword.” The adage is familiar to our ears and sounds convincing. Someone who has had the experience of sitting with pen and paper as armed security officers broke through the door would probably disagree. Unfortunately, brute force is generally more persuasive than even the most beautifully turned phrase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But there is an exception to every rule, as the extraordinary life of Nobel Prize-winning author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn shows. Solzhenitsyn was born in 1918, just as the Bolshevik Revolution solidified its power over his Russian homeland. His life tracks almost perfectly the optimism, exuberance, arrogance, brutality, lunacy, and despair of the effort to put Karl Marx’s ideas into practice. Marx’s philosophy promised to bring about universal equality, full liberation, and worldwide community. Marxism vowed to fully conquer nature, relieving the human race of scarcity, contingency, alienation, and anxiety. Marx’s aspirations were so striking that vast numbers of people, including Solzhenitsyn, committed themselves to bringing them into being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solzhenitsyn abandoned his youthful idealism the hard way. While serving as an artillery officer in World War II, he was arrested, convicted, and sent to the Gulag (the Soviet forced labor camps) for criticizing Joseph Stalin. It was only in the camps that he realized that nothing had worked out as Marx predicted. In conversations with fellow prisoners, he learned that Lenin had initiated a ruthless security state, suppressing any opposition to Bolshevik rule. After Lenin’s death, the paranoid and sadistic Stalin gained power and began an effort to remake human beings in the communist mold. Property was confiscated, businesses nationalized, churches closed, farmers forcibly relocated to agricultural communes, and so-called “class enemies,” people from the upper or middle classes, whose only crime was being born into the wrong family, sent to the Gulag. It impossible to estimate how many people were executed by Stalin, but we know that working conditions in the camps were so poor that tens of millions died of starvation, disease, and exhaustion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solzhenitsyn spent almost seven years in these harsh conditions of captivity. Unlike most victims of communism, Solzhenitsyn found a method of retribution. He began to record the crimes of the Soviet government. Since he was not permitted paper and pencil, he chronicled Soviet misdeeds by memorizing thousands of lines of poetry. After serving his sentence, he edited the poems into the multi-volume Gulag Archipelago, an allusion to the vast chain of forced labor camps spread throughout the Soviet Empire like islands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Gulag Archipelago was more than a history of wrongdoing. Tyrants have existed throughout history, but the magnitude of Stalin’s ferocity was unparalleled. Why did people obey a maniac? How could human beings be so cruel? Marx claimed that once the Revolution occurred, there would be no need for the state. As a result, Marxists made no provision for limitations on government or checks on ambition, hoping instead that History would ameliorate conflict. When Stalin took over leadership of the Party, Solzhenitsyn shows, communists could not discern whether he was a psychopath or represented the true direction of progressive history. They were helpless to oppose his ruthless commands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solzhenitsyn displays with great force that Marxist ideology motivated both Stalin and his followers to perpetrate the greatest inhumanity in history. Marxists’ goals are idealistic but implausible because
                    <ol> 
                        <li>
                            Human beings cannot be completely free; they need government to restrain their baser instincts. The german philosopher Immanuel Kant believed that the central duty of government was to ensure liberty. But he sensed that there was something wrong with the ordinary definition of freedom. It should not be thought of in libertarian terms: as the ability to do whatever we want. We are free only when we act in accordance with our own best natures; we are slaves whenever we are under the rule of our own passions or those of others. As he put it, ‘a free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same.’
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            So freedom isn’t an absence of government: a free society isn’t one that allows people more and more opportunity to do whatever they happen to fancy. It’s one that helps everyone become more reasonable. The good state represents the rational [which I disagree with because it is a mistake to think of morality as rational] element in everyone, it rules according to ‘a universally valid will under which everyone can be free.’ Government, ideally, is the ext  ernal, institutionalised version of the best part of ourselves. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            Nor can people be made equal, for there are differences in talent, ambition, and character: 
                            <blockquote>
                                <q>Human beings are born with different capacities. If they are free, they are not equal; if they are equal, they are not free.</q>(Solzhenitsyn, Gulag Archipelago)
                            </blockquote>. 
                            What we seek is equality of opportunity. Equality of outcome is totalitarian.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Perhaps most importantly, although humans can be selfless, it is imprudent to expect them to forego self-interest or ignore the good of their families and friends.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                Hi
                I've read the abridged Gulag Archipelago and it changed my worldview, for better or worse:
                <br><br>
                First;
                It's the most profound exposition on the subject of good and evil as I've ever come to assimilate. Solzhenitsyn has penned other masterpieces, but the Gulag Archipelago stands beyond for the most complete panoply of the reptilian descent of the most violent era in human history. It's a book on the most important event of the 20th century, more so than the transistor or nuclear power, the computer or airplane, than rocketry or antibiotics: these represent mere pieces of technological innovation, things that would scarcely be if not for their social (thus, spiritual) matrix. 
                We should be taught this, but Hitler, a mere disciple of this (true) fascism, gets all the luck. Perhaps they don't teach us for fear of independence. One of my favorite quotes in this multi-volume masterwork: "A simple step of the courageous individual is not to take part in the lie. One word of truth outweighs the world."
                <br><br>
                
                Second;
                It advised my view on the meaning of life [clichéd, perhaps], which many mistake to be prosperity, but is really the maturation of the soul: But, of course, we are all fed a perversion of this. I recall one of the lessons pupils at my alma mater were taught, viz., "Life is a journey".. This is the antithesis of what I've learnt it to be. 
                Because life, or the universe, is essentially playful: it doesn't have a destination that it ought to arrive at, and so is best thought of by analogy with music, because as an art form, music is essentially playful: we say you 'play' the piano, you don't 'work' the piano, because music differs from travel, where you try to get somewhere. The whole point of the composition is not the end of the composition: the best conductors aren't those who play the fastest. When you're dancing, you don't aim at a particular spot in the room: that's where you arrive; The whole point of the dancing is the dance. 
                Now, we aren't taught that to manifest in our quotidian conduct. We have a system of schooling (which I lambaste as it's the first ideological system we encounter at our most impressionable epoch. It goes on to shape our subsequent years: Everyone is, after all, either trying to prove or disprove who they were in high school) that leaves a completely different impression. It's all graded. And what we're taught, from a young age, is to doggedly chase after an arbitrarily set of goals (this is what the westernized perversion of goals is imputed to): kindergarten to first grade, first grade to high school, then college, then graduate school, and finally you enter 'the real world'. Then you land a job, have a quota to make, then you're going to make that, and the whole time the 'thing is coming' but never truly arrives, as a result of these goals we never even consider the higher purpose of. We constantly live for a future (for others, in many cases) that will never arrive: we do this to do this to do... That is, in short, what money is: it's a promissory note. It reflects the sort of pathology we ail from towards living.
                This is why we have such an anxious society: living constantly in the future. This is why we have such a depressive society: languishing in the past, which of course we would do if our authenticity, like a thorn in the side, whispers every now and then 'what if'... "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation" - observed Henry David Thoreau, predicating it even on our status quo. 
                This is all not to champion the philosophy of 'carpe diem' (drink today, for you may die tomorrow') or that money is unimportant. I'm not berating our obsession with planning to say that it's worthless, or castigating money as the root of all evils. What I am saying is that planning for the future is useful to those who can learn to live in the present, and that money is the slave of a wise man, the master of a fool.
                Scripture teaches us that our current suffering is a corollary of past sins. That would mean that those who 'suffered' most throughout history were the absolute worst of humanity. And yet, as is so often the case, the perpetrators live the most voluptuous life, while the naive and the innocent 'suffer' the greatest. If, however, we view meaning in earthly existence to lie not in prosperity, as we are taught, but in development of the soul, then we see that those people who neglected their good were punished most horribly of all: they degenerated into a swine-like & reptilian existence, departed downward from humanity, devoid of what Aristotle defined as 'excellence' as a human being. This is what we should qualify suffering to mean: not a lack of prosperity, but a lack of ethical development.
                What our indoctrination of the future does is it places the economy before justice: result before essence. Otto Rank observed that by our evolution, humans are driven by 2 fears: that of death, and that of life. The former follows from the latter, so in either case we will do everything we can to survive. We are taught that we must survive, whatever the cost. It's more than a rhetorical thing, because "whatever the cost" morphs into "at the cost of other people" which is what our society reflects in its obsession with these idealized zero-sum* games it terms "healthy competition" and fear-driven* diversified investments it justifies as "don't keep your eggs all in one basket". 
                Focusing on results doesn't sound bad, since at least, it can get work done, even the 'lifting civilization up' kind...
                However, for so long as we strive toward this 'result', we are slaves of time, not just prisoners, nor serfs (they at least possess freedom of the most important kind --- mind and spirit; that is, enlightenment.). Existence does not determine consciousness, but just the opposite: consciousness and steadfast faith in the human essence decides whether you become an animal or remain a human being. And the fact is that the group because of its unconsciousness, has no freedom of choice, so that, within it, psychic life works itself out like an uncontrolled law of nature. There is set going a casually connected process that comes to rest only in catastrophe.. For when new conditions not provided for by old convention arise, then panic seizes the human being who has been held unconscious by routine, much as it seizes an animal, and with equally unpredictable results.
                <br><br>
                
                Third;
                And this is why I favour the quote: "A simple step of the courageous individual is not to take part in the lie. One word of truth outweighs the world."
                This belief in the power of the individual, not only to combat tyranny, but also to maintain the health of a society was shared by many other great thinkers of the past few centuries, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Friedrich Nietzsche, William James, and Carl Jung. These days such a view is unfashionable. 
                Instead it is far more common to believe that social change results primarily from collective action and that an emphasis on the individual is selfish and will do little to improve the conditions of a society. 
                
                While collective action, in the sense of cooperation among groups of people to achieve common ends, is manifestly an important vehicle for engendering change, it will be ineffective at bringing freedom to an unfree world if people do not first strive to set themselves right, free their minds of the incessant indoctrination they have been exposed to and in the process develop into strong, independent and effectual beings. 
                
                Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote: "The antidote to this abuse of formal government, is, the influence of private character, the growth of the individual." 
                
                Looking back at recent history one will notice a commonality amongst the most brutal dictators of the 20th century, be it Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Castro, or Kim Il-Sung. Namely, they all stressed the import of the collective over the value of the individual. Examining why tyrants such as these, as well as modern authorities are such proponents of collectivist ideologies will make it clear why one must look to the individual to counter tyranny. 
                
                Those who desire to rule over others do not espouse collectivist ideologies because they believe it will benefit those over whom they rule, rather they do so because it provides them with a secure source of power. The immense benefits of collectivism for those who desire power arise from the fact that collective ideologies are amorphous. In other words, given that a collective is merely a group of people, collectivist ideologies can be built around innumerable possible factors; be it race, ethnicity, wealth, religion, or what is most common today, the country in which one resides. 
                
                Ludwig von Mises wrote: "There is no uniform collectivist ideology, but many collectivist doctrines. Each of them extols a different collectivist entity and requests all decent people to submit to it. Each sect worships its own idol and is intolerant of all rival idols." 
                
                There is no denying that as social beings, humans have a natural yearning for community and a desire to attach themselves to some form of a collective. But those who desire to rule over others do not want people to attach themselves to any such collective, rather they want people to elevate to the position of superiority of a specific collective. 
                
                Over the past several generations it is the nation state which has most commonly been elevated to the position of the supreme collective by those who desire and seek to rule over others. It hasn't been a spontaneous process as without indoctrination and heavy doses of propaganda it is far more likely that people would identify more closely with their local communities and others they have more intimate connections with --- not millions of people in cast geographic areas. 
                
                But indoctrinating people to worship the collective of one's nation is extremely valuable for politicians, as they are viewed as the leaders of these collectives --- and thus the more people who identify with the nation state, the more minds those in power have under their control. 
                
                But while offering immense benefits to the ruling elite of a nation, this form of collectivism paves the way for tyranny. As Carl Jung explained:  
                
                "The increasing dependence on the State is anything but a healthy symptom; it means that the whole nation is in a fair way to becoming a herd of sheep, constantly relying on a shepherd to drive them into good pastures. The shepherd's staff soon becomes a rod of iron, and the shepherds turn into wolves." --- Civilization in Transition 
                
                The ability to indoctrinate people to believe in the supremacy of a certain collective and thus to be turned into what Jung called a 'herd of sheep' is crucial for a tyrannical regime to maintain control over a population. 
                
                This is evidenced by the fact that even in countries such as North Korea during the famine of the 90s or the Soviet Union under Stalin's reign, where the populations were starving, mostly unarmed, and where the rulers had at their disposal massive police forces, spy networks, and prison systems, these tyrannical regimes still found it necessary to make use of massive amounts of propaganda to glorify the collective of their nation.  
                
                What this shows is that brute force is not enough to maintain tyranny, rather a tyrannical regime will only maintain power if they can control the minds of their subjects. When one realizes that gaining control of the minds of individuals is the most vital means for controlling a population it becomes clear that the first step in countering tyranny is to undergo the difficult process of freeing one's own mind. 
                
                Psychologist Jordan Peterson wrote in his book Maps of Meaning: 
                
                "Our petty weaknesses accumulate, and multiply, and become the great evils of state. As our technological power expands, the danger we pose increases --- and the consequences of our voluntary stupidity multiply. It is increasingly necessary that we set ourselves --- not others --- right, and that we learn explicitly what that means." 
                
                Concentrating first and foremost on setting ourselves right should not be viewed as selfish, as those who preach the values of collectives would like people to believe. On the contrary, those who set themselves right and free their minds from state indoctrination provide great services to others. As human beings we all face similar struggles and therefore those who find solutions for themselves, act as role models for other members of a society. 
                
                The great historians Will and Ariel Durant emphasized that a study of history reveals that a healthy society depends upon "individuals with clarity of mind and energy of will... capable of effective responses to new situations." Nietzsche wrote that "the self-reliant, independent, unprejudiced men [are] the pillars of a strong civilization". While the historian Arnold Toynbee suggested that "a loss of creative power in the souls of creative individuals" is one of the key factors that leads to the breakdown of civilizations. 
                
                With this in mind it should be clear the crucial role that individuals must play in the creation of a free world. For what is needed most in a society dominated by oppressive government is role models who show by example what it means to be free. Without such people, no collective action, no mass movements, no election of a new leader who promises "change" will ever bring about anything but temporary and superficial relief. 
                
                Butler Shaffer wrote:  "This is the only way in which any meaningful social change can ever take place; it will either arise within each individual, or it will not occur at all...Those who insist upon change coming from above, as something to be imposed upon mankind by institutional authorities, have given up on people. They have lost their confidence in the life processes that exhibit themselves only within individuals... It is now time to give people a chance to give people a chance to bring order to the world by bringing themselves to order." 
                
                While we are taught to believe that the individual is impotent in the presence of the great social problems which confront us today, the truth is the individual is far more powerful than commonly believed. One who has freed their mind, set themselves right, and in pursuit of the truth is unafraid to boldly speak their mind even in the face of severe opposition, has, in the words of Jung, "unknowingly and involuntarily become a leader" --- a role model which others will naturally strive to emulate. 
                
                Such an individual will have become one less pawn in an oppressive system, and whether they are aware of it or not, will have assumed a crucial role in the regeneration of society. As Jung correctly observed: 
                
                "The psychology of the individual is reflected in the psychology of the nation...Only a change in the attitude of the individual can initiate a change in the psychology of the nation. The great problems of humanity were never yet solved by general laws, but only through regeneration of the attitudes of individuals." --- Civilization in Transition

                Lastly;
                ..and again, it's the most profound exposition on good and evil as I've ever read, where Solzhenitsyn's brilliance shines forth, to the effect that it renewed my sense of what is really worth fixing - one's self. 
                Adolescents for a while develop a Piagetian 'messianic' complex, seeing themselves in a major effort to reform the world. By late adolescence, attention shifts from egocentricism to a newfound sociocentricism. They begin to focus on values that have long term implications rather than those that emphasize immediate gratification and goal satisfaction. Focus of attention shifts from the self to others. 
                The danger arises when they begin viewing, in due course, that to change the world is to change other people. They don't realize that the line that separates good and evil passes not through states, nor classes, nor political parties, but right through every human heart --- and through all human hearts. The line shifts, oscillates with the years. 
                And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained and even in the best of all hearts, there remains... an unuprooted small corner of evil.
                Ideologies are social theories that..
                This has been the truth of all the thousands of organized or personal religions spanning history: they struggle with the evil inside a human being: inside every human being. It is impossible to expel evil in its entirety, but possible to constrict it. This is the falsehood of all revolutions of history: They destroy only those carriers of evil contemporary with them (and also fail, out of haste, to discriminate the carriers of good as well). And they then take to themselves as their heritage the actual evil itself, magnified still more, because its in one's most evil moments that they are convinced what they are doing is good, and are well supplied with systematic arguments.
                "We would prefer to say that such people cannot exist, that there aren't any. It is permissible to portray evildoers in a story for children, so as to keep the picture simple. But when the great world literature of the past --- Shakespeare, Schiller, Dickens --- inflates images of evildoers of the blackest shades, it seems somewhat farcical and clumsy to us. The trouble lies in the way these classical evildoers are pictured. They recognize they themselves as evil-doers, and they know their souls are black. They precisely identify their motives as being black and born of hate. But no; that's not the way it is: To do evil a human being must first of all believe that what he's doing is good, or else that it's a well-considered act in conformity with natural law. Fortunately, it is in the nature of the human being to seek a justification for his action. Macbeth's self-justifications were feeble --- and his conscience devoured him. Iago was a lamb. The imagination and the spiritual strength of Shakespeare's evildoers stopped short at a dozen corpses. Because they had no ideology. 
                Ideology --- that is what gives evildoing its long sought justification and gives the evil doers the necessary steadfastness and determination. That is the social theory which helps to make his acts seem good instead of bad in his own and others' eyes, so that he won't hear reproaches and curses but will receive praise and honors. That was how the agents of the inquisition fortified their wills: by invoking Christianity; the conquerors of foreign lands, by extolling the grandeur of their Motherland; the colonizers, by civilization; the Nazis, by race; and the Jacobins (early and late), by equality, brotherhood, and the happiness of future generations. Thanks to ideology, the twentieth century was fated to experience evildoing on a scale calculated in the millions. This cannot be denied, nor passed over, nor suppressed. How then, do we dare insist that evildoers do not exist? And who was it that destroyed these millions? Without evildoers there would have been no Archipelago.

                *[point 2] Zero sum, because it doesn't create new sources of wealth or even serve to lift civilization to a new level, [&] 'fear-driven', because it intends to keep options open in case you are ousted by a fellow competitor (which is foolish because you can't diversify enough to know all of what you are doing, and no frontier has ever been set by diversifying your attention. And yet students rack up an impressive resume for over a decade in hopes of 'getting accepted', or on the argument that 'its the basics'. As with many things, its paradoxical: the things we want most are ends to the means that are opposite to the ones we've chosen.
