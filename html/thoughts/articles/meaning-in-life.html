                <blockquote>
                    <q>The truth is that as the struggle for survival has subsided, the question has emerged: survival for what? Even more people today have the means to live but no meaning to live for.</q><br> 
                    (Viktor Frankl, The Unheard Cry for Meaning)
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    For as long as consciousness prevailed, life has dogged humans with the ultimate question: how does one live best in the world? What, in other words, is the ultimate meaning of life? It is uncertain. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    For millennia, individuals and collectives answered life by sacrificing themselves to a divine entity---their prime motivator was instinctual, religious, and traditional. Then, they had sacrificed god to the modern age, marked by the French Revolution---<q>god is dead, and we have killed him,</q> so they begun looking to the collective and to mystery to derive meaning. But now, with nothing else left to answer the question, we have sacrificed meaning itself to certainty. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every age has its own mass neurosis. In 16th century France, it was pride and selfishness; in ancient Greece, hypocrisy and decadence; in our time, it is groupthink (blind conformity and lack of individuality) and lack of responsibility to oneself (Nihilism) disguised as meaninglessness. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We don’t know where to turn to for our answers to life; the gods in the sky have moved away, so we look to others to copy their answers <i>(Conformism)</i>, to be given answers <i>(Authoritarianism)</i>, or don’t look at all <i>(Nihilism)</i>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our age was doomed to witness evil-doing on an unprecedented scale owing to this fateful combination of collective envy in the form of ideology or herd morality, and consequent boredom with life: 
                    <blockquote>
                        “the road to Auschwitz was built by hate, but paved with indifference.”<br>
                        (Ian Kershaw)
                    </blockquote>
                </p>

                <h2><q>What is the meaning of life?</q></h2>
                    <h3>We don't ask; each is asked.</h3>
                        <p>
                            It is a mistake to think that we can ask such a question in the first place as ‘what is the meaning of life,’ since it’s not about what we expect of life, but what life expects of us; it is not <i>us</i> who do the asking, but us who <i>are</i> asked. Each individual is questioned every moment, and each must contrive a unique answer for the unique circumstances of their lives---no man can tell another what that answer is, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t there. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One can only answer to life by answering for his own life; these answers take the form of responsibilities because the only way to solve worthwhile problems is to make commitments, which entail sacrifices. Thus, individual---not collective---responsibilities go into the very essence of life.
                            <blockquote>
                                “Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator? Why has every man a conscience then? I think that we should be men first, and subjects afterward. . .The only obligation which I have a right to assume is to do at any time what I think right.”<br>
                                (Henry David Thoreau, Civil Disobedience)  
                            </blockquote>                      
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The question of meaning in life isn’t to be answered in the abstract, but by the lived truth and the culmination of every-day life. One doesn’t know the meaning of a movie, which comprises myriads of scenes, unless they understand each of the components. Doesn’t the same apply to life, a decades-long flick whose meaning can only be revealed in the last moments, on the verge of death? And doesn’t meaning depend on the quality, i.e., the extent to which the potential for humanity has been realized, of each of the component moments?
                        </p>

                    <h3>Even if we could ask such a question, we couldn’t answer it</h3>
                        <p>
                            It is not the meaninglessness of life that we have to endure, but our inability to grasp the unconditional meaningfulness of life with our limited rationality that we must bear. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            An ape that is punctured again and again to develop poliomyelitis serum wouldn’t be able to grasp the meaning in its suffering, because the concept of the individual responsibility to its future is beyond its intellect. Could the same not be said of us in relation to our inability to grasp the ultimate meaning of life, of the possibility that there exists a world beyond our perception that could answer just that? It is highly likely; humans do not, after all, represent the final evolution within the cosmos. 
                            <blockquote>
                                “I consider reality the thing one need concern oneself with least of all, for it is, tediously enough, always at hand, while more beautiful and necessary things demand our attention and care”<br>
                                (Hermann Hesse)
                            </blockquote>
                        </p>

                    <h3>The danger of generalizing the question</h3>
                        <p>
                            One of the reasons why ideologies are liars is that they answer what they can not ask; meaning in life is something that is relevant only to individuals, for only individuals live, and not collectives. Any collective can only give a <em>generalized</em> answer of some abstracted ideal that it excuses for meaning, which in actuality varies from individual to individual, and from moment to moment. 
                        </p>

                        <p>Every individual has his own abilities and vocations, is thus suited to fulfill the accomplishment of a certain task, and therefore can not be compared with any other individual, or replaced, or have his life repeated. As Viktor Frankl observed:
                            <blockquote>
                                “To put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion: ‘Tell me, Master; what is the best move in the world?’ There is simply no such thing as the best or even a good move apart from a particular situation in a game and the particular personality of the opponent. The same holds for human existence.”<br>
                                (Man's search for Meaning)
                            </blockquote>
                        </p>

                    <h3>...and of not answering</h3>
                        <p>
                            Most people excuse themselves in not making their necessary sacrifices to the commitments that would make up their responsibilities, in favor of neutrality in life. 
                            <blockquote>
                                “So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.”<br>
                                (Revelation 3:16)                                
                            </blockquote>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As a result of their deliberate idleness, cowardice, or apathy, they themselves are sacrificed by the interests of the herd, and ultimately moan of <em>meaninglessness</em> and a feeling of emptiness, which is a symptom of being in an existential vacuum. Their performance wanes, and they develop the symptomatic triad of existential frustration. ---<em>aggression</em>, <em>depression</em>, and <em>addiction</em>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Nevertheless, there is no such thing as a <em>meaningless</em> life. To live is to suffer and to find meaning in that suffering. The meaning of suffering, too, stands or falls with the hypothesis of life’s meaning. Humans can endure the senseless suffering, which is ultimately relative, of their lives provided they have a <em>reason</em>. The problem arises when one experiences a life of <em>only</em> suffering, nothing to look forward to, no <em>his own</em> life to answer, and no <em>their own</em> responsibility to assume---they have complete freedom, yet freedom is only the <em>negative</em> half of a phenomenon whose positive half is <em>individual responsibility</em>. No man can be truly free who has never been a slave. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Ultimately, it is a loss of <em>individual</em> responsibility in the world that allow for our individual stupidities and weaknesses to multiply and become the great evils of state, for as Stanley Milgram noted:
                            <blockquote>
                                “The disappearance of a sense of responsibility is the most far-reaching consequence of submission to authority.”
                            </blockquote>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The dictatorial regimes of the past century, concentration camps, economic recessions, and violent gangs attest to the consequences of having a society that lacks a basis in the idea of sacrifice, and decides that morality is relative---namely, the most extreme form of carpe diem. What use is there, after all, in sacrificing for a tomorrow if you may die today? Take what you can. You’re alive at 21? Not for long. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            If there is no responsibility to bear, and if each individual is simply a number to be replaced, then meaning orientation has subsided, and consequently the seeking of immediate pleasure had taken over.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, one who sincerely answers these questions of life will realize the impossibility of his replacement, so his sense of responsibility will magnify. He who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears towards another that affectionately waits for him, or towards an unfinished work, can never throw his life away. He has a ‘why,’ and so, can bear any ‘how.’ 
                        </p>

                <h2>Where does meaning come from?</h2>
                    <h3>Ersatz meaning</h3>
                    <p>
                        We’ve seen that meaning in life isn’t constant, but it is eternal. Those who are existentially frustrated fall prey to thinking that the will to power---particularly the most primitive form of the will to power, i.e., money---or the pursuit of pleasure are meaningful. In reality, these are compensations.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Legitimate sources of meaning</h3>
                    <ol>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Deep relationships</strong>: Many people unknowingly adhere to what is known in Psychology as <em>Object Relations Theory</em>, which is based on two key assumptions:<br> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    that the maturation of one’s personality can only be facilitated through interpersonal relationships,
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    and that these relationships are <strike>the primary, if not sole,</strike> [a] source of meaning in life. 
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li><br>

                        <li>
                            The Object Relations Theory neglects, however, that meaning can be found, and personal growth stimulated, when we cultivate in solitude a relationship to some form of <strong>creative work</strong>.<br>
                            As the 20th century psychiatrist Anthony Storr argued in his book Solitude: A Return to the Self, in the struggle to give form and order to an external creative work, we are also, often without knowing it, imposing form and order on our mind. 

                            <blockquote>
                                “…maturation and integration can take place within the isolated individual to a greater extent than I had allowed for…introverted creators are able to define identity and achieve self-realization by self-reference, that is, by interacting with their work rather than by interacting with other people.”<br>
                                (Anthony Storr, Solitude: A Return to the Self)
                            </blockquote>                             
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            In the absence of the ability to create or to form deep relations (or even to pleasure or to dominate)---as is the situation for incapacitated patients, or those under imprisonment or torture---where people are unable to change their circumstances, they are challenged to change <em>themselves</em>.<br>

                            In a chapter titled The Development of Personality contained in Volume 17 of C.G.Jung’s Collected Works, he provides a fascinating account of what he called the ‘<strong>achievement of personality</strong>,’ which he described as “the prototype of the only meaningful life, that is, of a life that strives for the individual realization of its own law.”
                        </li>

                    </ol>

                <h2>What are some of the obstacles in man’s search for meaning?</h2>
                    <h3>The danger of rationality</h3>
                        <p>
                            When we take rationality to its logical endpoint, we encounter its final imperative:
                            Life is a sexually transmitted disease with a fatality rate of 100%. In any case, it is transitory, our achievements will be forgotten soon, and if not, the universe will undergo a ‘Heat death’ anyway, so everything we do is doomed to oblivion; life is thus meaningless, and so not worth living.
                        </p>
            
                        <p>
                            To answer this question, we are challenged to find meaning in the pain, guilt, and death that inhere to life.
                        </p>

                        <p>TL;DR: Truth serves life</p>

                    <h3>1) <em>existing</em></h3>
                        <p>
                            This imperative of Nihilism (the belief that life has no meaning) is fundamentally rooted in the argument:<br>
                            “Only what is measurable constitutes 'reality,' and only this 'reality' is capital-T True, therefore only Science is true because science is the rational and logical measurement of all things.”<br> 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Thereby, 'meaning,' being something that cannot be classified, proven, or even ‘discovered,’ is cast off by this paradigm. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We forget, however, that it is impossible for mortal men to establish absolute truth, but relative truth only; we can never experience the universe as it is, but as <em>we are</em>. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is because, as living beings, we do more than merely exist---we <em>live</em>, and Life cannot be logically rendered to pointlessness because man does not and can not operate by logical truth alone: he has the ability to feel, sense, have dreams and visions and hopes, seek fulfilment, and exercise the choice under a determined set of circumstances; while these aren’t ‘real’ (measurable or logical or provable) they influence that reality in a really big way. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We live in more realities than pencils or skeletons, and are thereby governed by more truths than the objective. A man is thus not complete when he lives in a world of <em>statistical</em> truth. He must live in a world of his <em>biological</em> truth, because of his bodily nature, and because he is a conscious being whose consciousness is a function of his biology and does not float above his body. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is evinced by the discovery of the frame problem in artificial intelligence---Early pioneers in the field thought the easier part would be giving machines the ability to see (to perceive), and the harder part would be teaching them how to think. But it turns out that our ability to make meaning out of what we see is inextricably bound up in the way we think. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Man must, therefore, live in a world of his biological truth, which means that man has <em>always</em> lived in the myth---It is <em>we alone</em> who have devised ‘cause,’ ‘sequence,’ ‘for-each-other,’ ‘relativity,’ ‘constraint,’ ‘number,’ ‘law,’ ‘freedom,’ ‘motive,’ and ‘purpose / meaning’; and when we project and mix this symbol world into things as if it existed "in itself," we act once more as we have always acted---mythologically.

                    <h3>2) Transience</h3>
                        <p>
                            The only thing transitory about life is its potentialities. Once a responsibility is assumed, these potentialities are stored in the past, and have become permanent in the universe.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A thing assigned to the past isn’t irretrievably lost, but irrevocably stored, even if no one is there to remember it. The transitoriness of life isn’t an argument against it. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We need to learn to look at the glass as half full; we need to learn to envy our elders because instead of possibilities in their future, they have realities in their past that they can take pride in for the breadth of suffering and depth of experience and heights of life they have reached as a result of all that accumulated experience.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Above all, we need to learn to be <em>tragically</em> optimistic instead of pessimistic or worse, <em>naively</em> optimistic; the pessimist dismays at the calendar getting thinner by the day, while the tragic optimist carefully files the filled sheets and looks back on them with pride; the naive optimist doesn’t even look.

                            In his incarceration in the Nazi death camps, Viktor Frankl noticed how most of his fellow-inmates who had died in without being gassed had simply lost their sense of purpose in life, begun living in the past, and viewed the present as something unreal and pointless, while those who remained aligned with a future goal inexplicably maintained their humanity and even health in such conditions by learning to, because of their self-realized responsibility, look at the present as a spiritual trial, and manifest a vital sense of humor.

                        <p>
                            From this, we can appreciate that it is not existence that determines consciousness, but just the opposite: consciousness, and a steadfast faith in the human spirit defines whether one becomes an animal or remains a human. We yearn to know how to live through such times with dignity, but we ought to learn how to live and die without them. It isn’t misfortune that corrupts people; those corrupted have stepped into misfortune already corrupted from a past of spiritual poverty. 
                            <blockquote>
                                “Yes, the camps were calculated and intended to corrupt. But this didn't mean that they succeeded in crushing everyone. Just as in nature the process of oxidation never occurs without an accompanying reduction...so in camp, too (and everywhere in life), there is no corruption without ascent. They exist alongside one another.”<br>

                            The inner strength to face adversity and to ascend can be facilitated by orienting oneself to a future goal to look forward to. It is ironic that the more misfortune (tyranny) that befalls man, the more self-imposed rules and responsibilities---self-tyranny---he requires to maintain his hope and his sanity.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As we see, this struggle for meaning will result in an inner tension, but it is precisely this tension that is crucial to mental health and flourishing in life. Those who succeed in life do not strive towards an equilibrium, to tranquilize themselves with ‘happiness’---to Epicureanism, to rest, to attain ‘unity,’ to be finally at ‘peace with oneself’---as an ideal, or to bring an end to the war they are. Rather, to these rare self-actualizers, this war of self-overcoming “has the effect of one more charm and incentive of life” (Nietzsche, BGE). This, I think, is true peace: not to be in a place where there is no trouble, noise, or hard work, but to be in the midst of these things and still maintain calm in one’s heart. The most peaceful place in the world is the eye of the storm.

                    <h3>4) Irresponsibility</h3>                        
                        <p>
                            Perhaps the most interesting observation of human nature is that no man is capable of supporting meaning in his life unaided by something outside of him, and the moment he is free, he readily enslaves himself to maintain his sanity.

                        <p>
                            This is because man is not only his body, his Psyche, or some closed system: being human, he is directed by his humanity to look outward into the world for his sense of meaning, whether through experiences, relationships, or creative work. Interestingly, the more one forgets himself---by directing his energies towards his meaning---the more he actualizes himself, and thus becomes human. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Thus, to be human is to direct oneself to something other than oneself, yet the only way to do this legitimately---individual responsibility---is to be by oneself.

                    <h3>5) Prove it</h3>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, it would seem that Life is not a disease man can die from, because of the fact that the psyche isn’t entirely confined or subjected to space, time, or their laws---it is quite evident that humans are, and always have been, capable of such things as visions of the future, premonitions, looking around corners, etc.. Therefore, it is possible that there is a practical continuation of life, of a sort of psychical existence, beyond time and space. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Of course it is obvious we are all going to die, and this is the sad finale of everything, but nevertheless, the unconscious, which is a fragment of nature, deals with the imminence of death as if it wouldn’t happen---it <em>disregards</em> it. Life behaves naturally as if it were going on, so it would seem better to go along with this natural phenomenon, to live on, and to look forward to the next stage, because then one lives properly. But if he is afraid, if he petrifies, if he looks back, if he goes against the natural path of the subconscious, there will invariably be a compensatory reaction: he dies before his time. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Yes, this can’t be ‘proven,’ it is merely a psychological fact, but by that same token, it can’t be disproven either, and in any case wouldn’t matter because we aren’t all matter. Death is best regarded as a goal because, in the longest term, it feels better. We don’t know why we need physical contact or hugs, but we partake because we feel better---similarly, if we act in a certain way, if we think along the lines of nature, then we live properly. Does it matter that this proves something? It is simply so.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            “Meaning and purposefulness are not the prerogatives of the mind; they operate in the whole of living nature. There is no difference in principle between organic and psychic growth. As a plant produces its flower, so the psyche creates its symbols.”<br>

                <h2>In conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        The question of meaning in life is ultimately a naive question because we can not ask it, and because Life is not the attaining of some aim through the active creation of something of value, but so far as we can answer what we’re asked, it must include the wider cycle of life and death, of dying and of pain. The gods in the sky have gone, but they have moved into the individual---the locus of the divine is thus the individual and not the state.
