                    The thirst for knowledge has consumed humanity since the dawn of civilization. However, until recently there have been numerous “gate-keepers” to the world of knowledge. Up until the 19th century much of the world’s population lived a hand to mouth existence with only the rich capable of quenching the thirst for knowledge. Even as the West saw dramatic increases in living standards, barriers to knowledge remained throughout the 20th century. Prior to the Internet most knowledge was conveyed to the masses through an increasingly centralized educational system and the mass media. What this meant was that those who controlled these institutions controlled what ideas were deemed worthy of mass-transmission.

                    The advent of the Internet has initiated a revolution like no other. The Internet is slowly smashing all barriers to knowledge by giving individuals across the globe free and easy access to the vast library of ideas built up by humanity. For the first time in history we can seriously say that knowledge is free – no gatekeepers remain.

                    The goal of this website is to further the spread of knowledge, focussing on The ideas put forth by humankind’s greatest philosophers, scientists, and economists. These great individuals left us with a commodity more valuable than all others. Some people have said that money rules the world, some say politicians, some say weapons – they are all wrong. The truth is that ideas rule the world, they always have and always will. It is ideas that will, for better or worse, shape the destiny of mankind.

                    The goal is to continue spreading the message of individual liberty and empowerment to the world.
